        <p> <strong>YIELD</strong> Serves <br>
            <strong>TIME</strong> 1 hour 35 minutes, plus marinating<br>
            <strong>INGREDIENTS</strong><br>
            <ol>
                <li>½ cup honey</li>
                <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons ketchup</li>
                <li>4 pounds pork spareribs, cut into serving pieces</li>
            </ol><br>
            <strong>PREPARATION</strong><br>
            (1)In a pan large enough to fit the ribs, combine the honey, soy sauce, garlic, ketchup and 1/2 cup water. Marinate the spareribs in this mixture in the refrigerator for several hours, turning a few times.<br>
            (2)Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to low. Arrange the spareribs on a hinged grill basket and cook over a low flame, basting occasionally, for 1 1/2 hours or until the ribs are shiny brown and fork-tender. As the meat cooks, the basket should be turned frequently so that neither side gets charred.<br>

            <strong>YIELD</strong> 4 to 6 servings<br>
            <strong>TIME</strong> 20 minutes<br>
            <strong>INGREDIENTS</strong><br>
            <ul>
                <li>3 tablespoons neutral oil, like canola or grapeseed</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
                <li>1 red bell pepper, stemmed, cored and roughly chopped</li>
                <li>2 carrots, peeled and finely minced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 cup peas (defrost if frozen)</li>
                <li>black pepper</li>
                <li>cilantro</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>¼ cup Shaoxing wine, or water</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced ginger, or to taste</li>
                <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>3 to 4 cups cooked white rice, cooled</li>
                <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>

            </ul>
            <strong>PREPARATION</strong><br>
            (1)Put 1 tablespoon of the oil in a wok or a large skillet, and turn heat to high. When it begins to shimmer, add onion, pepper and carrots and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and beginning to brown, 5 to 10 minutes. With a slotted spoon, remove vegetables to a bowl.<br>
            (2)Drain peas if necessary, and add them to skillet; cook, shaking pan, for about a minute, or until hot. Remove them to the bowl.<br>
            (3)Put remaining oil in the skillet, followed by garlic and ginger. When the mixture is fragrant, about 15 seconds later, add the rice, breaking up clumps with a spoon as you go along and tossing it with oil. When the rice is well coated, make a well in the center and break the eggs into it. Scramble these, then stir into the rice<br>
            (4)Return vegetables to the skillet and stir to integrate. Add wine or water and cook, stirring, for approximately 1 minute. Add soy sauce and sesame oil, then taste and add salt and pepper if necessary. Turn off heat, stir in the cilantro and serve.<br>
